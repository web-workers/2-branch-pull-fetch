# Git Branch, Pull, and Fetch
## Git Branch
One of the most powerful things about git is the ability to branch off from the main “trunk” of the code in which to create a new feature, test some new concept, upgrade packages, etc.

This is super powerful because it gives us as a team of developers the ability to work somewhat agnostic of other team members in our own little code world.  I as a developer can branch off of some other branch and I am now in my own little repo world I can make changes, I can break things, etc without fear of accidentally pushing up my code to the “source of truth” branch and potentially getting a bug deployed into production.
